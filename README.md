# System-Analysis-And-Design

#Briefly summarize the DriverPass Project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client of the DriverPass project was Liam who was the owner. Liam wanted to create a system that allowed users to train and study for their driving exams at their local DMV. Liam wanted his customers to be able to take practice tests online and to be able to schedule appointments for practicing driving.


#What did you do particularly well? 

I believe the part that I did the best on were creating the different diagrams for the system. Each diagram was a different function or type of diagram that explained a part of the system. The diagrams went into detail and explained how a certain part of the system worked and what it should do. 


#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of these documents, I would revise the technical requirements in the Project Two Design Document. I would revise this because I believe I missed some things on it, and I could improve upon it by doing further research and go into detail why I think these requirements are necessary for the system.


#How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by following what we learned during the interview process. We made an outline of everything the user wanted and needed for this system and was able to deliver that process in an efficient way. It’s important to consider the users needs when designing because they are the client, and it is their name on the product. It is up to the developer to make sure the clients needs are exceeded and that the client receives what he is wanting.


#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analze and design a system?

I would approach designing software by first meeting with the client and discussing what their needs are for the system. I would then begin to create diagrams for the system and map out what each part of the system should do. Techniques that I would use in the future would be to gather system requirements and gather system needs from the client in order to make the system as good as I can.
